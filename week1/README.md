# Colab and Python Notebooks

## Lab structure

- Introductions
- Brief overview of the [Moodle page for the course](https://moodle.unil.ch/course/view.php?id=17164), the Slack channel, the Git repository
  - Brief intro on how to use Slack. Everyone please join [the class Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-yrv2725/shared_invite/zt-ul6jzzmd-S2LXimp4wBdKWARU_TFsTw). We will use Slack for all course-related communications outside the class & lab.
  - **Slack Exercise** (everyone): Post a message under `#general` introducing yourself, where you are from and a fun fact about you.
- **[Walkthrough](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week1/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb)**: introduction of Google Colab & Python Notebooks
- Brief explanation of __Assignment 0__ due Sunday October 10, 23.59pm. You can find the full description of the assignment [here](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=841167). To get an idea about this assignment, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX6whEGN1Y) from one of the previous years' submissions.

## What is covered in the [walkthrough Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week1/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb)

- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. The goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code to explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review) 
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on Google cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - What is the difference between Code and Text/Markdown: a Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
    - You will need a free Google account to access Colab (if you do not already have one)

## Additional resources (optional)
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
- Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code. When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Check out [this noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)
    
## Python [todo at home]
Python will be the main programming language we will be using throughout this course. If you feel like you need to review some basics about Python, you can follow this [Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) from Kaggle.


## Exercises

After you have become familiar with Colab you can do the following exercises:

**Exercise 1:**

Create your own brief CV/resum√© using markdown in Colab. You can use [this example as an idea to get you started](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/tree/master/week1/quickCV). Create a new notebook in Colab, then download and save this new notebook in your computer.

**Exercise 2:** Recreate [this](https://github.com/michalis0/DataMining_and_MachineLearning/blob/master/week1/Exercise2.png) in Colab.
